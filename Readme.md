# Python Maze Game - README

This file serves as the README for the original artifact: a single-file, terminal-based Python game created for IT-140. Developed as a personal project, this game demonstrates advancements in dynamic programming languages and core programming principles, including logic, control flow, and user interaction.

## Overview of the Game

The game is a text-based interactive maze adventure that runs entirely in the terminal. Players navigate through a series of rooms and scenarios using simple text commands, solving challenges and making decisions that affect the outcome. The design emphasizes problem-solving, creativity, and the application of foundational programming concepts.

Capstone Enhancements (Enhancements are independent of one another, representing improvements variably):
Enhancement One: Software-Engineering and Design - [Here](https://github.com/MalikSpruill/typescript-transpiled-maze-game)
Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures - [Here](https://github.com/MalikSpruill/algorithms-text-based-maze-game)
Enhancement One: Databases - [Here](https://github.com/MalikSpruill/saturn-runner-maze-game)

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players use text commands to explore and interact with the maze.
- **Dynamic Scenarios**: The game responds to player choices, offering a unique experience with each playthrough.
- **Terminal-Based**: No graphical interface is required; the game is fully playable in any terminal or command-line environment.
- **Single-File Simplicity**: All game logic and content are contained within a single Python file for ease of use and understanding.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python, chosen for its readability, flexibility, and suitability for rapid prototyping and dynamic programming.
- **Standard Library**: Utilizes Python's built-in libraries for input/output and control flow.

## How to Set Up and Play

1. **Prerequisites**:
    - Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    - Access to a terminal or command-line interface.

2. **Download the Game**:
    - Obtain the single Python file (e.g., `TextBasedGame.py`) from the project repository or course materials.

3. **Run the Game**:
    - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the game file.
    - Execute the game with:
      ```bash
      python TextBasedGame.py
      ```
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to play.

## Original Artifact for Capstone Enhancements

This Python maze game served as the original artifact for all three enhancements in my SNHU Computer Science Capstone Project. Each enhancement built upon this foundational project, demonstrating growth in software engineering skills and the application of advanced programming concepts.

## Author

This project was personally created by **Malik Spruill** for IT-140 and later used as the basis for the SNHU Computer Science Capstone. Feedback and suggestions are welcome.

## Notes

- Keep this README updated with any changes or improvements.
